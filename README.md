# Node.js with HTTPizza

All credit goes to Ruben Verborgh for his modifications done in the [original][og] repo. This is nothing more than a reapplication of those changes to the new Node version.

Modified version of [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
that exports the [HTTPizza protocol](https://github.com/ZeusWPI/HTTPizza)
as its `http` module instead of regular HTTP.

For building and installing, see [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/ZeusWPI/NodePizza/blob/httpizza/BUILDING.md).
If installing into a system directory, we suggest moving /usr/bin/local/node to /usr/bin/local/node-pizza.
